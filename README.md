geoMe
=====

geoMe is a small webApp that allows you to save a geopositionated place. Nothing more.

This app was developed by @oleurud for the sole purpose of make a small webApp based HTML5 and PhoneGap. And why not admit it, remember where I left my car (ouch!).

geoMe uses: HTML5 based geolocation, Google Maps, HTML5 local storage, Jquery Mobile and HTML5 based cache.

If you you want to transform the webapp into App for iPhone or Android, follow the instructions on Getting Started at PhoneGap.com
